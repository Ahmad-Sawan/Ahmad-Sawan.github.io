# Work Term 3 Report (W25)

## Abstract/Introduction

Welcome to a reflection of my third co-op work term at Canadian Solar Inc., also known as Recurrent Energy. Returning once again as a **Full Stack Software Developer**, I was entrusted with greater responsibilities, especially contributing to the foundational development of the **REView System**—a modern web-based platform for contractors and site operators.

This term challenged me to think deeply, plan strategically, and build systems that will scale. I worked extensively with both backend (Django) and frontend (Angular), and also focused on enhancing authentication mechanisms including **SAML**, **2FA**, and **multi-session handling**. In this report, I’ll outline the work I accomplished, the technologies I engaged with, and how this experience shaped my goals and learning outcomes.

## Conclusion

This work term marked a turning point in my development career. I was no longer simply “contributing” to projects but rather building foundational systems that others would rely on. My work on the REView platform helped me solidify advanced skills in full-stack architecture, authentication, and backend performance.

By deeply engaging in technical problem-solving and self-directed learning, I not only achieved the goals I had set but also gained new confidence in designing secure and scalable systems in a real-world environment.
