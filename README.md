# Ahmad Sawan


Hello and welcome! My name is **Ahmad Sawan**, and I am entering my fourth year of studies in Computer Science. 

Here, you'll find a collection of reflections and insights gathered throughout my professional journey. As I complete each work term, I take the opportunity to delve into my experiences, challenges, and growth, offering a candid glimpse into the world of work and learning.

Through these reflections, I aim to capture the work of each work term, sharing valuable lessons learned, and achievements 
Whether you're a fellow student, a  employer, or simply curious, I invite you to explore my reflections and engage with the evolving narrative of my professional development.

Join me as I navigate my professional experiences, embracing every experience as an opportunity for growth and discovery. Thank you for joining me on this journey.
