# Work Term 2 Report (S24)

## Abstract/Introduction

This page will show you a peek into my co-op work term, again, at Canadian Solar Inc., also known as Recurrent Energy. I've decided to return here because not only did a recieve a return offer, but because I truly enjoyed working here with amazing peers and supervisors that always push me to my best ability. Returning as a **Full Stack Software Developer** here, I've learnt so many new things that made me grow an even more attraction to this field.

Here, I will share snippets of this experience, showing what I did and the lessons I've learnt here.

## Employer
