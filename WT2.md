# Work Term 2 Report (SMR24)

## Abstract/Introduction

This page will show you a peek into my co-op work term, again, at Canadian Solar Inc., also known as Recurrent Energy. I've decided to return here because not only did a recieve a return offer, but because I truly enjoyed working here with amazing peers and supervisors that always push me to my best ability. Returning as a **Full Stack Software Developer** here, I've learnt so many new things that made me grow an even more attraction to this field.

Here, I will share snippets of this experience, showing what I did and the lessons I've learnt here.

## Employer

While Canadian Solar focuses on renewable energy solutions, the development, optimization, and monitoring of solar panels often involve technology and data analysis. Computer science comes into play through the development of software for solar panel efficiency, data analytics for monitoring solar farms, or even AI applications for predictive maintenance.

Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) was founded in 2001 and made its debut on the NASDAQ in 2006. Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has become a global leader in solar energy and energy storage solutions.
